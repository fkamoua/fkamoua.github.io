        <p>The wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus or Rana sylvatica[2]) 
            has a broad distribution over North America, extending from 
            the boreal forest of the north to the southern Appalachians, 
            with several notable disjunct populations including lowland 
            eastern North Carolina. The wood frog has garnered attention 
            by biologists over the last century because of its freeze tolerance, 
            relatively great degree of terrestrialism (for a ranid), 
            interesting habitat associations (peat bogs, vernal pools, uplands), 
            and relatively long-range movements.
